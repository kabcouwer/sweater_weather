## About The Project

A backend API for an application used to help plan road trips. This app will allow users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination.

### Learning Goals

* Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
* Expose an API that requires an authentication token
* Expose an API for CRUD functionality
* Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
* Research, select, and consume an API based on your needs as a developer



## Tools Used

| Development | Testing       | Gems            |
|   :----:    |    :----:     |    :----:       |
| Ruby 2.7.2  | RSpec         | Pry             |
| Rails 5.2.5 | WebMock       | ShouldaMatchers |
| JSON        | VCR           | Faraday         |
| Atom        | SimpleCov     | Figaro          |
| Github      | FactoryBot    | FastJSON        |
|             | Faker         |                 |




## Set Up

1. To clone and run this application, you'll need Ruby 2.7.2 and Rails 2.5.3. Using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) you can install Ruby 2.7.2 (if you don't have it already) with:
```sh
rbenv install 2.7.2
```
2. With rbenv you can set up your Ruby version for a directory and all subdirectories within it. Change into a directory that will eventually contain this repo and then run:
```sh
rbenv local 2.7.2
```
You can check that your Ruby version is correct with `ruby -v`

3. Once you have verified your Ruby version is 2.7.2, check if you have Rails. From the command line:
```sh
rails -v
```
4. If you get a message saying rails is not installed or you do not have version 5.2.5, run
```sh
gem install rails --version 5.2.5
```
5. You may need to quit and restart your terminal session to see these changes show up
